This area, that area, that place
or this place, l fear nothing

lf you dare
you will be butchered

13
00:03:26,505 --> 00:03:28,400
You gave him a good snub

14
00:03:30,516 --> 00:03:33,375
-Buddy, you are hot!
-l am Mirchi of Trichy -Come, you cheeky

15
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:35,942
Go and join an apt frequency

16
00:03:53,947 --> 00:03:54,878
Watch out

17
00:04:16,575 --> 00:04:17,506

Oh God!

20
00:05:06,645 --> 00:05:08,058
Hey, fool, look here

21
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:18,649
lt is hurting, leave me

22
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,869
Simran sister, save me from being hit

23

24
00:05:42,753 --> 00:05:43,684

25
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:11,608
Oh God!

26
00:07:14,775 --> 00:07:15,867
Careful Velu
Buddy, he is hanging

27
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:20,498
- Careful Velu
- Have l not made you dangle in mid air?

28
00:07:21,034 --> 00:07:22,929
That's why, l asked you
not to challenge me

29
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:33,043
Don't spree
Else, you will be contained

30
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:38,817
Now it is your turn to go down

31
00:07:42,101 --> 00:07:46,887
Make way for our leader
He is the southern tiger

32
00:07:47,513 --> 00:07:50,051
-Are you down now?
-lt looks like Gemini Circus

33
00:07:52,328 --> 00:07:58,560
Up's and down's are common
But ultimate victoy only counts

34
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:06,259
Don't leave him

35
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:11,072

-Bring it here, put the ladder
-Cops are coming

37
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:25,518
Both will be caught
What will you do now?

38
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:28,406
You can play kabaddi, cricket,
do Bharathnatyam..

39
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:31,776
..or even Kathakili
but should not be arrogant

40
00:08:34,052 --> 00:08:37,072
lf you are, you will topple, now watch.. .

41
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:49,106
Cops have come

-Who are you?
-Aathivasi -Do you mean tribal?

44
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,700
l belong to Madras,
so eveyone calls me like this

45
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:03,552
Eveyone's life has thousands of stages

46
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,849
This is a season of moon
We should escape soon

47
00:09:09,037 --> 00:09:12,217
Hey, come here

-Puli scratched me

49
00:09:16,258 --> 00:09:20,402
-What? -My friend Pulikesi
touched me and it started bleeding

50
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:22,326
Uncle, are fingernails poisonous?

51
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:29,067
Near Anaconda, Titanic,
Jurassic Park and Panagal Park ..

52
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:30,510
..there is a wine shop

53
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,240
Can't you understand?
He's asking you to go home & get boozed

54
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,288
-Get lost.. -Rascal
-He got caught

55
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:41,587
-Sir, leave my shirt, girls are watching
-Are you a Casanova?

56
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:45,437
Now-a-days guys like me
only are Casanovas

57
00:09:45,948 --> 00:09:48,325
- Sir, take off your hand
- You look like a damaged tanker lory..

58
00:09:48,836 --> 00:09:49,767
..and you are
bothered about your reputation

59
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:52,176
- Where is your leader?
- l'll say only if you leave my shirt

60
00:09:52,848 --> 00:09:54,582
- What did you ask?
- Where is your leader?

61
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:56,990
-Don't talk about him
-What? -Do you know what he did?

62
00:09:57,502 --> 00:10:00,361
-What did he do?
-He turned like this and ran off.. ..

63
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:22,991
Bangles iingle..
..in the hands

64
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:31,656
Bangles iingle..
..in the hands

65
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:36,470
Bangles iingle..
..in the hands

66
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:44,176
My dear came to my thoughts
on a dampish night

67
00:10:44,683 --> 00:10:45,614
Oh God!

68
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:48,879
Do you have sense?
You are coming this way

69
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,639
Will you not
come through the front door?

70
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:53,199
l am a Superman
This is how l will come

71
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:57,198
You rice sack, why are you
dancing here with these creatures?

72
00:10:58,026 --> 00:10:59,594
Bhuvana, ask him to stop,
else l will bite him?

73
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:02,794
Listen, don't insult us
They are my friends

74
00:11:03,304 --> 00:11:05,513
Who.. .these quarter and half tickets?

75
00:11:07,623 --> 00:11:09,511
- Go out
- Why...why should l go out?

76
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:13,671
l too have equal right in this room
Dad said so

77
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,509
She is not even 3 feet tall
but talks about rights

78
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:18,947
Now, you will go out

79
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:24,709
-Sachin Tendulkar has come
to the ne_ street -Sachin!!

80
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:26,465
l wanted to get an autograph
but couldn't find a good shirt

81
00:11:28,095 --> 00:11:30,304
Move aside, eveything is
scattered and damn this doll

82
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:34,623
-Brother, is it really Sachin?
-Yes, Sachin has come..

83
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,500
..Aishwaya Rai has come with him.. .

84
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,500
-They are shooting an ad film
in the ne_ street -Both of them?

85
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:45,497
They disappeared like a lightning

86
00:11:56,564 --> 00:11:59,893
-Where is he?
- Who?

87
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:17,167
After fighting in streets like a rogue
are you playing 'good boy'?

88
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:22,765
- Sister, mummy.. - This is not
a Police station, but our house

89
00:12:23,273 --> 00:12:26,923
Since morning 6 'O' clock
he is studying sincerely and you are..

90
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:34,601
ln the entire world, he is only guy
who studies wearing a petticoat

91
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,075
l mistook petticoat for dhoti

92
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:43,875
- In my exuberance to study...
- Is it so?

93
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:46,274
Dad, he's lying, don't believe him

94
00:12:47,264 --> 00:12:48,832
Just few minutes back, he came from top

95
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:52,992
- Why are you covered with soot?
- He only did that

96
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:55,710
He said Sachin and Aishwaya Rai
has come for shooting

97
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,469
and made us roam in the streets

98
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,707
l didn't say that

99
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:02,427
l said 'Sachidhananda Swamigal
has come to the nearby temple..

100
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:04,666
..and you will get
Aishwayam from his blessings'
